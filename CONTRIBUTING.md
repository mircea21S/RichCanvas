If you have questions or you're not sure how things work, you didn't find any docs to answer your question, please open a new [Q&A discussion](https://github.com/mircea21S/RichCanvas/discussions/new?category=q-a).
With time I will try to create a FAQ section in the Wiki, once enough questions become frequently asked. 

Don't forget to check the [Issues](https://github.com/mircea21S/RichCanvas/issues) both closed or open or any other existing [Discussion](https://github.com/mircea21S/RichCanvas/discussions)
before raising a new question.

## üêõ Found an issue?

Found a bug or you noticed something doesn't work as expected? Just raise a new [issue](https://github.com/mircea21S/RichCanvas/issues/new?template=bug-report.md) and let us know, so we can fix it. 
Please provide as much detail as possible to help us address the issue.

## üí° New feature or enhancement suggestions

You have an idea about a new feature or enhancement or you need a feature that's not present in RichCanvas? Just open a [new feature ticket](https://github.com/mircea21S/RichCanvas/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) discribing your idea.
Also, you can come up with suggestions in the [Roadmap discussion](https://github.com/mircea21S/RichCanvas/discussions/45) this is the best place to come up with ideas, suggestions and so on.
Offering feedback on the roadmap is always appreciated!

## :zap: New feature or bug fix pull request

Whether is fixing a bug or implementing a new feature, make sure the issue exists, otherwise the submitted PR should contain the relevant description for the implementation. 

You can also help with existing features or bugs, for that check the opened [Issues](https://github.com/mircea21S/RichCanvas/issues) or look into the [Roadmap discussion](https://github.com/mircea21S/RichCanvas/discussions/45) 
where you can find ideas for future versions, planned or ready to be discussed.
Look for those already planned, discussed and described sufficently or feel free to start a new thread/discussion about any feature you would like to work and you don't have all necessary information.

> [!TIP]
> Tips when working with RichCanvas codebase
> - Please respect the .editorconfig rules and best practices
> - I suggest installing [CodeMaid](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SteveCadwallader.CodeMaid) extension, RichCanvas repository contains a configuration file for this that works
with the .editorconfig one
> - Always run locally the UI Automation Tests before submitting the PR
> - Try to cover your new feature or bug fix with a new or existing UI Automation Test 
(a guide can be created once the Automation Tests projects will be refactored, look for that in the [Roadmap discussion](https://github.com/mircea21S/RichCanvas/discussions/45))

## üìù Help with documentation

The current [documentation](https://github.com/mircea21S/RichCanvas/wiki) might not cover all available functionalities. If you find something is completely missing, contains errors or you have suggestions for improvment,
please let us know or update the docs yourself!
